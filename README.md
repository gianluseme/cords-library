# Cords-Semantics

Cords-Semantics is a Python library designed for tagging the artifacts of MLflow runs and generating semantic descriptions for artifacts using the ontology provided by CORDS. This library helps interpret and utilize data from MLflow runs more effectively in machine learning projects, and prepares the assets to be shared in an IDSA (International Data Spaces Association) ecosystem.
